## Weeks at a Glance
- **Week 1 – Bash, Git, GitHub**: Safe Bash scripting, Git power workflows, GitHub fundamentals (no Actions).
- **Week 2 – CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Build/test/cache artifacts, matrices, environments with approvals, OIDC-based deploys, and safe concurrency.

## Suggested Next Four Weeks
- **Week 3 – AWS Advanced**: ECS (Fargate/EC2), EKS (Kubernetes on AWS), service discovery, load balancing. **Huge focus on AWS networking** including VPCs, subnets, security groups, and network architecture. Databases: RDS (PostgreSQL/MySQL), DynamoDB basics. Architect projects using Eraser or draw.io; design multi-tier deployments with database integration.
- **Week 4 – Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform (state, workspaces, modules), CloudFormation basics, lint/validate/plan/apply in CI, policy-as-code guardrails.
- **Week 5 – Monitoring & Observability**: Metrics (CloudWatch, Prometheus), visualization (Grafana dashboards), alerting basics and dashboarding best practices.
- **Week 6 – End-to-End Integration**: Bring all weeks together—deploy a production-ready app using GitHub Actions → IaC → ECS/EKS with observability. Secrets management: AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, and secure rotation.
